# Learning GLFW
A repo to learn the GLFW library.

## Repo Structure
The root folder contains the gitignore, README, and license files, along with several folders that have their own projects and CMake files within them. All of the folders are their own application, completely seperate from one another, and teach a different thing in GLFW, e.g. EmptyWindow shows the most basic GLFW program, an empty window.
