This is the main note-taking file for this repo.

- glfwInit() must be called before any other GLFW or related functions etc, returns true if successful and inverse

- glfwWindowHint(GLFW_RESIZABLE, GL_FALSE) renders any windows created after unresizable.

- glfwCreateWindow(int, int, int, const char[], GLFWmonitor*, GLFWwindow*) will return a GLFWwindow pointer, or window "handle" to a new window that will be created with the side affects of the function

- glfwMakeCurrentContext(GLFWwindow*) probably does something, I don't know. Crashes on start without it.

- gladLoadGLLoader(GLADloadproc) will start GLAD and its functionality, returns true if successful.

- glViewport(int, int, int, int) sets the position and size of the viewport

- glfwWindowShouldClose(GLFWwindow*) will return the shouldClose flag set on the passed window

- glClearColor(GLfloat, GLfloat, GLfloat, GLfloat) sets the color bits (all default to 0 when not called) to be used with glClear(GLbitfield)

- glClear(GLbitfield) clears the buffer specified by the pased bitfield, essentially drawing whatever is in the buffer

- glfwSwapBuffers(GLFWwindow*) will swap the buffers of the passed window

- glfwPollEvents() will check for input, window closes, etc.

- glfwGetKey(GLFWwindow*, int) will check if the passed int (usually in the form of a GLFW macro e.g. GLFW_KEY_ESCAPE) is being pressed in the passed window

- glfwSetWindowShouldClose(GLFWwindow*, int) will set the shouldClose flag on the passed window. The passed int should be GL_[TRUE, FALSE] instead of a regular int

- glfwTerminate() will terminate the session of GLFW. glfwInit() will need to be called before using GLFW functionality again

- glad.h must be included before glfw[version].h
